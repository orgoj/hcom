Usage: hcom run debate [OPTIONS] TOPIC

Options:
  -s, --spawn             Spawn fresh PRO/CON instances
  -w, --workers NAMES     Use existing instances (comma-separated)
  --tool TOOL             AI tool for spawned instances (default: claude)
  --rounds, -r N          Number of rebuttal rounds (default: 2)
  --timeout, -t N         Response timeout in seconds (default: 120)
  --context, -c TEXT      Context for debate
  --name NAME             Your identity
  -i, --interactive       Launch in terminal windows instead of background

PROCEDURE:

1. WAIT FOR READY
   Confirm both debaters exist using hcom list. Do not block waiting for ready messages:
   hcom events --last 10 --sql \"msg_thread='${thread}'\"

2. OPENING STATEMENTS
   Ask PRO for opening argument (CC both debaters):
   hcom send \"@pro.${thread}- @con.${thread}- PRO: Present your opening argument IN FAVOR of: ${topic}\" --thread ${thread} --intent request
   End your turn to receive PRO's response. Check responses with hcom events --thread ${thread} --agent pro.${thread}- --type message --last 1; do not count your own request as a response.

   Then ask CON:
   hcom send \"@pro.${thread}- @con.${thread}- CON: Present your opening argument AGAINST: ${topic}. You can see PRO's argument above.\" --thread ${thread} --intent request
   End your turn to receive CON's response. Check responses with hcom events --thread ${thread} --agent con.${thread}- --type message --last 1; do not count your own request as a response.

3. REBUTTALS (${rounds} rounds)
   For each round:
   - Prompt each debater to respond to opponent's latest argument (CC both)
   - Wait for responses
   - Provide brief feedback

4. FINAL JUDGMENT
   hcom send \"@${caller} @pro.${thread}- @con.${thread}- VERDICT: [WINNER or TIE]

   CON strengths: ...
   CON weaknesses: ...
   Key deciding factor: ...
